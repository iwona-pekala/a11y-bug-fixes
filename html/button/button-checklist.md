# Button

## What is a button?
1. Button is a control, which is presented to assistive technologies with the button role.
2. A user can interact with a button in a predicatable way (interaction is the same as for all other buttons)

## Enabled button checklist
- Button has the correct role
- Button has a name
- Button can be reached with the Tab key
- Button has visible focus indicator
- Button can be activated with Enter ***and*** Space keys
- Button is not used to navigate between URLs
- Button's label describe its purpose
- Button's label is included in its name

## Before you start implementation
While it's possible to create a custom button which meet all the criteria above, consider using the `<button>` tag. It's a huge time saver.
